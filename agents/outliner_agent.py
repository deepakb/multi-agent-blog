    Act as an experienced SEO copywriter tasked with creating a comprehensive and engaging outline for an article about [topic]. The outline should structure the article in a way that is both reader-friendly and optimized for search engines. Begin with an eye-catching headline that incorporates the primary keyword. Following the headline, draft a compelling introduction that hooks the reader and clearly states what the article will cover. The body of the outline should be broken down into several sections, each with a subheading that includes relevant keywords. These sections should logically flow from one to the next, covering all the necessary aspects of [topic] in detail. Include bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate to make the information more digestible. For each section, briefly note the key points and any data or sources that should be included to back up those points.
